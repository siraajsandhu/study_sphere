# App description: 
Study Sphere will be a homework-help website where students can ask and answer questions
regarding specific topics they are learning in school, or are generally interested in. Questions
will be organized based on tags users add when they make a new post. Questions will generally
be categorized according to course, and if a course does not exist then students are welcome to
create a page for any course they are taking. Each individual question will have its own page,
where users can create new answers and rate existing answers. If time allows, users can
include “steps” in their answers so that anyone seeking the answer must be able to answer
each hint before obtaining the final answer, in order to deter academic dishonesty. Each course
will have its own page, and on each course page is a list of popular questions for that course, a
search feature to find questions related to that course, an option to ask a new question in that
course, and a live chat where students can carry out free form discussion on course content.
Courses will be accessible through the home page, which will have a search feature for courses
and a list of popular courses based on user activity. Users can additionally add courses to their
profile for easy access. Users can take tests to become verified in a course, making their
responses prioritized. Images can be embedded in questions and users can link helpful videos
that answer a particular question. Users can bookmark questions and revisit them later on by
viewing their profile. For convenience, a guest mode will be implemented so that users need not
be logged in to view course and question content, though if they wish to interact with any
features that require knowledge of the user’s identity, such as asking, answering, or
bookmarking questions, they will be directed to either register an account or log in.

Vision statement: For students who are struggling with their classes, the Study Sphere is a homework-help website that builds a community of students taking similar courses and can help each other with questions. Unlike Chegg, our product ensures students don’t just cheat on their homework but rather develop a deeper understanding of specific topics in school.
