Meeting 1 (10/28)
- reviewed and got feedback on major app features with TA
  - major frontend pages: login, registration, home, classes, questions, profile
- asked TA how to store images in our database
  - solution: use cloud hosting (AWS) and store url in DB or directly store base64 encoding in DB. will need to explore both methods later.
- plan for future: begin implementing frontend for each endpoint. 

Meeting 2 (11/04)
- each group member explained the progress they made this week and got feedback from TA. Began working on frontend features like login/registration
- Feedback:
  - elect team leader to better organize work
  - each group member should work in a separate branch, then merge to main
  - always merge with main to avoid conflicts
  - try and reduce dependencies between tasks so that people are blocked less often

Meeting 3 (11/11)
- went over progress of this week: more work on frontend for homepage, class page, question page, and profile (login/registration finished finally). Back end is currently being developed for login/registration as well as homepage and class page.
- Feedback:
  -  move change password from profile into a settings page
  -  speed up progress as we go into final week
  -  complete front end & back end at the same time
  -  begin integration of pages starting next week at the latest

Meeting 4 (11/18)
- Went over progress of this week: search API for our search bar, home page is essentially done as well as backend, class page is a WIP, question page is a WIP. Profile page has been fixed to incorporate feedback from last meeting.
- Feedback:
  - try and finish before break so we can focus on presentation.
